# Chapter-3: Working with Sessions, Error Handling, and Caching in Go
Sometimes, we would like to persist information such as user data at an application level rather than persisting it in a database, which can be easily achieved using sessions and cookies. The difference between the two is that sessions are stored on the server side, whereas cookies are stored on the client side. We may also need to cache static data to avoid unnecessary calls to a database or a web service, and implement error handling while developing a web application. With knowledge of the concepts covered in this chapter, we will be able to implement all these functionalities.

Here we will cover the following topics:
- Creating an HTTP session
- Managing your HTTP session using Redis
- Creating an HTTP cookie
- Implementing caching in Go
- Implementing HTTP error handling in Go
- Implementing login and logout in a web application
